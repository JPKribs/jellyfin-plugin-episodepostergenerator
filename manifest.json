        "changelog": "## Notice\r\n\r\n### Major Version\r\n\r\nThe current versioning scheme is Jellyfin-Major.Jellyfin-Minor.Plugin-Version. So, 10.10.1 is Jellyfin 10.10 and version 1 for the plugin. This does a good job of tracking plugin versions and the supported Jellyfin version but it doesn't do a good job of tracking major version changes.\r\n\r\nThis is a note that this version (10.10.27) is a huge architectural change. You may need to uninstall and reinstall this plugin as the underlying settings for this plugin have changed dramatically to support **series specific posters**!\r\n\r\n**This means, you can set a poster per series (or multiple series) or use a single default for all series.**\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n**Features:**\r\n\r\n  - Added multi-configuration support - create multiple named poster configurations with different styles\r\n  - Added series assignment system - assign specific series to use custom poster configurations\r\n  - Added default configuration that applies to all unassigned series\r\n  - Added visual series tags with poster thumbnails in configuration UI\r\n  - Added rename functionality for poster configurations\r\n  \r\n  **Fixes:**\r\n\r\n  - Fixed XML serialization error preventing plugin from loading (ICollection to List conversion)\r\n  - Fixed series names displaying as series.Name instead of actual names in UI\r\n  - Fixed Episode Font Size and Font Color visibility in Cutout style (now properly hidden)\r\n  \r\n  **Technical:**\r\n\r\n  - Refactored PosterConfiguration to use List<Guid> with proper XML serialization support\r\n  - Added Name property to PosterConfiguration for user-friendly identification\r\n  - Updated UI to use DOM manipulation instead of innerHTML to prevent translation system conflicts\r\n  - Added SuppressMessage attributes for CA1002 and CA2227 code analysis warnings\r\n  - Improved updateVisibility function to handle multiple conditional display rules\r\n  \r\n  **Other:**\r\n\r\n  - Improved UI styling with Jellyfin-themed series cards including poster images and hover effects\r\n  - Added delete protection for default configuration\r\n  - Improved configuration dropdown to display Default for first configuration\r\n  \r\n  **Documentation:**\r\n\r\n  - Updated configuration page with better field descriptions for multi-configuration workflow\r\n  - Reorganized settings documentation into Plugin Settings and Poster Settings sections",
