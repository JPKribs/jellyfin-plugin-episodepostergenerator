changelog:
  fixes: 
  - Fixed duplicate default configurations being created on every plugin initialization/restart
  - Fixed saved default poster configurations not persisting between restarts
  - Fixed UI showing only default configuration until new configuration was created
  - Fixed font color and font size controls not hiding for Cutout and Numeral poster styles
  technical:
  - Changed PluginConfiguration constructor to initialize empty PosterConfigurations list instead of creating default
  - Made IsDefault an explicit boolean property instead of computed property based on SeriesIds
  - Added automatic default configuration creation in PosterConfigurationService.Initialize() with persistence
  - Added null safety checks with error logging in GetSettingsForSeries() and GetSettingsForEpisode()
  - Updated configuration loading to properly deserialize from XML without constructor interference
  other:
  - Improved configuration dropdown sorting to show default configuration first, then alphabetically by name
  - Added validation to prevent users from naming configurations "Default" (reserved name)
  - Updated UI logic to use IsDefault property instead of index-based detection
  - Combined data-depends-on and data-hide-for-styles visibility checks to prevent conflicts
